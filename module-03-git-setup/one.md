# Version Control System

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that helps to *track* and *manage changes* made to files over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project, keeps a history of all modifications, and makes it easy to revert to earlier versions if needed. VCS ensures that code is organized, recoverable, and safely stored, making it an essential tool in software development.

Popular examples include **Git, Source Code Control System (SCCS), Subversion (SVN), CVS, and Perforce.** <br><br><br>

* Git is a **distributed** version control system <br>
     
     * We know about VCS but what is a distributed VCS? <br>
    
         Distributed VCS gives developers a complete copy of the entire project repository and  its history of modifications. Unlike Centralized VCS (SVN, CVS) it allows developers to work offline without relying on the central server and to make changes locally.
